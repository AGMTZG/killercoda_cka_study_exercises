### Congratulations!

You have successfully backed up and restored the etcd datastore in a Kubernetes cluster.

You now know how to:
- Use `etcdctl` for creating snapshots.
- Perform disaster recovery using restored data.
- Edit the etcd manifest for static pods.
- Validate cluster health after restoration.

This skill is essential for the **Cluster Maintenance and Troubleshooting** domains of the CKA exam.
