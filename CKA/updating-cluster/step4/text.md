### Upgrade kubelet on the controlplane node

The kubelet must match the controlplane version. Steps include:

- Draining the node to safely evict pods.
- Ensure the kubelet package is not on hold.
- Installing the kubelet package to the latest version (it must match the one installed with kubeadm).
- Restarting the kubelet to apply the upgrade.
- Put the kubelet package on hold.
- Uncordoning the node to allow new pods to schedule.
