WELL DONE !

You have successfully migrated from a Kubernetes Ingress to the Gateway API using HTTP routes without TLS.

In this exercise, you learned how the Gateway API provides a more modular and expressive approach to managing traffic within Kubernetes, compared to the traditional Ingress model.

You also saw how MetalLB enables external access in environments without a cloud-based load balancer, allowing the Gateway to function on bare-metal clusters.

At this point, your cluster is running with the NGINX Gateway Fabric, handling HTTP traffic through Gateway and HTTPRoute resources.

This foundation prepares you for more advanced topics such as configuring TLS, traffic splitting, or advanced routing policies using the Gateway API.

You solved this Challenge !
