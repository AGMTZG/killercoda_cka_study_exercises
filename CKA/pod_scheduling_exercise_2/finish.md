### Pod Scheduling — Affinity, Taints, and Tolerations: Part 2

**Congratulations!**

You have successfully completed this part of the scenario. Here's what you accomplished:

- Applied **tolerations** to allow pods to run on tainted nodes in more complex scenarios.
- Used **soft and hard affinity rules** to influence pod placement under stricter constraints.
- Learned how to design pod scheduling rules that are feasible given your cluster nodes, taints, and labels.
- Ensured that pods with interdependencies or placement preferences are scheduled correctly.

You can now apply these scheduling concepts in real clusters to make your workloads more reliable and efficient.

Well done!
