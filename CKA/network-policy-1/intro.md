### In Kubernetes, NetworkPolicies allow you to control traffic between pods, namespaces, and external endpoints.

These exercises will help you practice defining policies that:

- Restrict or allow communication between pods selectively.

- Manage incoming and outgoing traffic using ingress and egress rules.

- Enhance cluster security while maintaining necessary connectivity.

You will be creating and applying policies without modifying existing configurations, testing how traffic flows under different restrictions.
