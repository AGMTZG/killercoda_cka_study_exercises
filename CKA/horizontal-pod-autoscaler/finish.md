In this exercise, you learned:

- How the **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** dynamically scales applications based on CPU utilization.  
- How to define **minimum and maximum replicas** for better resource control.  
- How to configure **scaling behavior** to manage how fast replicas increase or decrease.  
- How to verify HPA activity and monitor application scaling in real time.

By implementing an HPA, you automated scaling decisions that help maintain performance and efficiency under varying workloads.  
Your application can now adapt intelligently to traffic and resource demands.

You solved this challenge !
