WELL DONE!

Congratulations! In this exercise, you learned how to:

- Enable the `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` feature gate in your Kubernetes cluster.

- Create a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` that validates mandatory and conditional labels on Pods.

- Bind the policy cluster-wide with `ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding`.

- Test Pods that comply with and violate the rules, and understand the resulting validation messages.

This scenario equips you with practical skills to enforce labeling standards automatically, ensuring consistency, auditability, and governance across your Kubernetes workloads.

You solved this challenge!
