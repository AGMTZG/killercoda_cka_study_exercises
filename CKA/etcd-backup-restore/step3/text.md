### Simulate a disaster recovery

In this step, you will simulate a disaster recovery scenario by deleting critical control-plane components. This helps you practice restoring etcd and ensuring cluster functionality.

You will:

- Delete the static pod manifests for the API server and Controller Manager.

Note: After deleting the static pod manifests, thereâ€™s no need to manually delete the corresponding pods from the kube-system namespace. The kubelet automatically terminates them when it no longer finds their manifest files in the configured directory.

```bash
# List static pod manifests
ls /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
# Expected output: etcd.yaml  kube-apiserver.yaml  kube-controller-manager.yaml  kube-scheduler.yaml

# Remove the API server and Controller Manager manifests
sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml

```
