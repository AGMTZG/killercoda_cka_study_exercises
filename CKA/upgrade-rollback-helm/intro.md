### Managing Application Releases Using Helm

**Introduction**: </br>
In this scenario, you’ll deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm, perform configuration changes, and manage rollbacks.

**Scenario**: </br>
Your manager has asked your team to deploy the **Nginx** chart version from the **Bitnami** repository `https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami` to the Kubernetes cluster in order to test custom server configurations before applying them to the corporate Nginx deployment, ensuring that they do not break the server.

This is intended as a **temporary release for validation purposes**, and will be removed after testing.
