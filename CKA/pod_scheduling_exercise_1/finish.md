### Pod Scheduling — Affinity, Taints, and Tolerations

**Congratulations!**

You have successfully completed this scenario. Here's what you accomplished:

- How to use **tolerations** to allow pods to run on tainted nodes.
- How to use **soft and hard affinity rules** to influence pod placement.
- How to design pod scheduling rules that are feasible given your cluster nodes and taints/labels.

You can now apply these concepts in real clusters to ensure your workloads are efficiently and correctly scheduled.

Well done!
