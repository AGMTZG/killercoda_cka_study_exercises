### Managing Application Releases Using Helm

**Introduction**: </br>
In this scenario, you’ll deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm, perform configuration changes, and manage rollbacks.

**Scenario**: </br>
Your manager has asked your team to deploy the Nginx chart (version 13.2.22) from the Bitnami repository (https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami) to the Kubernetes cluster in order to configure and test TLS, ensuring that the TLS certificates are functioning correctly.

Your tasks include:

- Deploy the chart to the cluster and verify the release, along with all associated pods and services.

- Upgrade the chart configuration, then inspect the changes and troubleshoot any issues.

- Roll back the release to the previous stable version.

- Remove the release and clean up all associated resources from the cluster.
