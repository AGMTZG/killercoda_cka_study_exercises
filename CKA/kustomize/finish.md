Well done !

In this scenario, you:

- Used Kustomize overlays to adapt the configuration for development and production environments.
- Added environment-specific labels, environment variables, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
- Applied patches to include initContainers and set folder permissions.
- Configured production-specific resource requests, limits, and node tolerations.
- Learned how to maintain a single base configuration while customizing deployments for multiple environments efficiently.

This workflow demonstrates best practices for managing Kubernetes resources in multi-environment scenarios using Kustomize.

You solved this challenge!
