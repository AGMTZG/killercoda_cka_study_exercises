### Install Prometheus Operator on Kubernetes

**Introduction**  
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit widely used in Kubernetes environments. It collects metrics from your applications and infrastructure, stores them efficiently, and allows you to query and visualize them. Using Prometheus, you can monitor resource usage, detect issues early, and ensure your applications run smoothly.

In this scenario, you will install the **Prometheus Operator** on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm. The Prometheus Operator simplifies deploying and managing Prometheus instances by automating configuration, lifecycle management, and monitoring resources.

**What you will do**  
- Install the Prometheus Operator using Helm.  
- Create a basic **Monitoring Resource** for an Nginx pod to start collecting metrics.  
- Verify that metrics are being exposed correctly in Prometheus.
