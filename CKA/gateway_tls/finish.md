WELL DONE!

You have successfully migrated from a Kubernetes Ingress to the Gateway API with TLS enabled.

In this lab, you learned how the Gateway API provides a more flexible, modular, and expressive model for managing traffic in Kubernetes compared to traditional Ingress resources.

You also implemented secure HTTPS traffic using either cert-manager or OpenSSL, creating and configuring certificates and secrets for your Gateway.

Additionally, you saw how MetalLB enables external access in environments without a cloud-based load balancer, allowing Gateways to work seamlessly even in bare-metal clusters.

At this point, your cluster is running with the NGINX Gateway Fabric, handling encrypted traffic through Gateway and HTTPRoute resources.

This achievement sets the stage for more advanced topics such as traffic splitting, advanced routing policies, and mutual TLS (mTLS) within the Gateway API ecosystem.

You solved this Challenge !
