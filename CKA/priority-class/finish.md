Well done! 

You’ve explored how Kubernetes uses **PriorityClass** to influence scheduling behavior when resources are limited. By defining and applying custom priority levels, you observed how the scheduler decides which workloads stay running and which ones get preempted to make room for higher-priority pods.

In this exercise, you learned how to:

- Create and register new **PriorityClass** objects.

- See how scheduling decisions shift based on pod priority.

- Observe **preemption** when higher-priority workloads require node capacity.

- Inspect and verify priority assignments across running pods.

Mastering these concepts helps you maintain predictable behavior when your cluster faces resource pressure, ensuring critical workloads get the capacity they need.

You solved this challenge!
